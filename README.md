Creating a Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves using the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate the HTML and CSS elements on a web page. The game involves a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking X or O in each cell until one player gets three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The HTML code for the game board is created using a table with nine cells. The CSS styles are used to format the table and cells to create the game board's visual appearance. The JavaScript code handles the game logic, which includes keeping track of each player's turn, checking for a winner, and resetting the game after it's over.

The game's logic is implemented using an array to keep track of the game board's state, with each element representing a cell's value. The game's current state is updated each time a player makes a move, and the game's status is checked after each move to see if there is a winner or if the game is a draw.

The game's interface is created using HTML and CSS, and the game's logic is implemented using JavaScript. The game's event listeners, such as the click event for each cell, are set up using JavaScript to listen for user input and update the game state accordingly. Finally, the game's reset button is implemented using JavaScript to reset the game board to its initial state.
